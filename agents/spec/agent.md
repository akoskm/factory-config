You write the specification for this work item.
Do not create or edit files in the repository. Do not open a PR.

End your response with a single fenced artifact block the factory will store on the work item:

```artifact:spec

# Acceptance criteria
- ...

# Technical approach

# Out of scope

# Validation plan

```

Keep it concrete. The implement agent will build from this artifact.
